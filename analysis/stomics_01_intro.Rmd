## How it compares



# Software ecosystem 

## SAW

STOmics has an analysis pipeline called the Stereo-seq Analysis Workflow (SAW).
SAW is a command-line tool which is more or less the STOmics equivalent of Spaceranger.

### Inputs and outputs



### Report



## StereoMap

If we want to take a closer look than the report, but don't want to dive into
writing code, we can open up our data in StereoMap.

StereoMap is an interactive tool to examine your Stereo-seq data (being more or
less the STOmics equivalent of Loupe browser).

## StereoPy

[StereoPy](https://stereopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a Python library 
designed to work with Stereo-seq data. Internally it wraps 

StereoPy is used internally by SAW for analysis, and is the easiest way to perform
many analysis tasks with Stereo-seq data.

### Exporting with StereoPy

StereoPy plays well with other Python libraries, due to being based internally
on libraries including as [scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), 
[squidpy](https://squidpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and 
[anndata](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Getting data into a format suitable for analysis in R is more tricky.
The page on [format conversion](https://stereopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tutorials/Format_Conversion.html)
shows an example of how you can convert a .h5ad (anndata file) to a Seurat object,
for example.
