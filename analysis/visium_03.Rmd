## Introduction

In this part of the workshop, we will learn how to create some spatial plots using 
Seurat and how to customise them.

## Load packages and data

```{r message=FALSE}
library(Seurat)
library(qs)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
```

We will be using the Seurat object that we have QCed and normalised in [part 2](visium_02.html).

```{r}
dat <- qread("output/visium_seurat_qced_norm.qs")
dat
```

## SpatialFeaturePlot

SpatialFeaturePlot is a function in Seurat that allows you to plot a feature (e.g., 
the expression of a gene) of the spots over the image of the tissue.

For example, let's plot the expression of CD3D gene of our data.

```{r}
SpatialFeaturePlot(dat, features = "CD3D")
```

Often, the spots may look too small, like in this case.
We can increase it by increasing the `pt.size.factor` parameter.

```{r}
# store it so we can use the same number later on
pt_size <- 5
SpatialFeaturePlot(dat, features = "CD3D", pt.size.factor = pt_size)
```

We can also adjust the opacity of the spots and the image underneath it by
tuning the `alpha` and `image.alpha` parameter accordingly.
The higher the number, the less opaque the spots and image will be.

```{r}
# Dimming the spots
SpatialFeaturePlot(dat, features = "CD3D", pt.size.factor = pt_size, alpha = 0.3)

# Dimming the image
SpatialFeaturePlot(dat, features = "CD3D", pt.size.factor = pt_size, image.alpha = 0.5)

# Completely removing the image
SpatialFeaturePlot(dat, features = "CD3D", pt.size.factor = pt_size, image.alpha = 0)

```

If a range is passed onto the `alpha` parameter, it will alter the minimum and maximum opacity.
This is handy if you want to accentuate the higher expression as we can lower
the minimum opacity (which defaulted to 1) and increase the maximum opacity.

```{r}
SpatialFeaturePlot(dat, features = "CD3D", pt.size.factor = 5, 
                   image.alpha = 0.5, alpha = c(0.5, 3))
```

In the plot above, each spot is coloured by the expression of CD3D gene.
Notably, because the active assay of the data was set to SCT before we run `SpatialFeaturePlot`,
the CD3D expression we plotted above is not the raw UMI count, but rather the count
that has been normalised using SCTransformed, stored in the `data` layer.

We can run the function on the raw unnormalised count by changing the default assay
and setting the slot parametr to the `count` layer:

```{r}
DefaultAssay(dat) <- "Spatial"
SpatialFeaturePlot(dat, features = "CD3D", pt.size.factor = pt_size, image.alpha = 0.5,
                   slot = "count")
```

In one SpatialFeaturePlot call, we can visualise multiple features.
E.g., let's visualise four genes, CD3D, CD3G, CD4, CD8A, :

```{r}
DefaultAssay(dat) <- "SCT"
SpatialFeaturePlot(dat, pt.size.factor = 5, 
                   image.alpha = 0.5, features = c("CD3D", "CD3G", "CD4", "CD8A"))
```

You can set how many columns do you want to spread the images across
by specifying the parameter `ncol`.

```{r}
SpatialFeaturePlot(dat, pt.size.factor = 5, 
                   image.alpha = 0.5, 
                   features = c("CD3D", "CD3G", "CD4", "CD8A"), ncol = 4)
```

By default, the plot will focus on the the area of the tissue where the spots are.
Disabling this by setting crop to FALSE will show the entire tissue.

```{r}
SpatialFeaturePlot(dat, features = "CD3D", crop=FALSE, image.alpha = 0.5, 
                   pt.size.factor = 3)
```

## SpatialDimPlot

SpatialDimPlot is different from SpatialFeaturePlot in that it allows us to
visualise qualitative features.

For example, let's visualise the spot by the patient ID metadata we added in
[part 1](visium_01.html) before.

```{r}
SpatialDimPlot(dat, group.by = 'patient_id', pt.size.factor = pt_size,
               image.alpha = 0.5)
```

There are some parameters that are shared between SpatialDimPlot and SpatialFeaturePlot,
like `pt.size.factor`, `image.alpha`, `alpha`

We can override the spot colour by setting the `cols` parameter with
a named vector mapping the discrete category in the data against the colour.
To visualise this, let's pretend we have 3 patients in our data.

```{r}
# pretend we have three patients in the data
dat[[]]$pretend_patient_id <- c(
  rep("Adam", 3000),
  rep("Jane", 700),
  rep("Clare", 259)
)

SpatialDimPlot(dat, group.by = 'pretend_patient_id', 
               pt.size.factor = pt_size, image.alpha = 0.5,
               cols = c("Adam" = "#0096FF", "Jane" = "orange", "Clare" = "#023020"))
```

We can also highlight only spots that belong to certain group and grey out the rest.
E.g. let's discretise spots based on their CD3D expression

```{r}
SpatialDimPlot(dat, pt.size.factor = pt_size, image.alpha = 0.3,
               cells.highlight =  list(
                 "CD3pos" = WhichCells(dat, expression = CD3D > 2),
                 "CD3neg" = WhichCells(dat, expression = CD3D <= 2)),
               cols.highlight = c(
                 "CD3pos" = "yellow", 
                 "CD3neg" = "grey70"))
```

We can also split the image such that we have 1 panel each for each group.

```{r}
SpatialDimPlot(dat, pt.size.factor = pt_size, image.alpha = 0.3,
               cells.highlight =  list(
                 "CD3pos" = WhichCells(dat, expression = CD3D > 2),
                 "CD3neg" = WhichCells(dat, expression = CD3D <= 2)),
               cols.highlight = c("yellow", "grey70"),
               facet.highlight = TRUE)
```

## Further customising the plots

Both `SpatialFeaturePlot` and `SpatialDimPlot` will return a `ggplot` object,
which we can modify using the functions and notations built into the `ggplot2` package.

As an example, let's update a feature plot showing CD3D expression such that we: 

1. Use the viridis colour scheme.
2. Rename `CD3D` to `CD3D SCTransformed exp`
3. Have a black background and white axes

```{r}
# Default SpatialFeature Plot
plt_dark_bg <- SpatialFeaturePlot(
  dat, 
  features = "CD3D",
  pt.size.factor = pt_size,
  image.alpha = 0
) 

# 1) Overriding the colour scheme to viridis
plt_dark_bg <- plt_dark_bg + scale_fill_viridis_c(option = 'viridis')

# 2) Rename `CD3D` to `CD3D SCTransformed exprssion`
plt_dark_bg <- plt_dark_bg + labs(fill='CD3D SCTransformed exp') 

# 3) Have a black background and white axes
plt_dark_bg <- plt_dark_bg +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
  legend.text = element_text(colour = "white"),
  legend.title = element_text(colour = "white"),
  legend.background = element_rect(fill = "black"),
  plot.background = element_rect(fill = "black"),
  panel.grid = element_blank(),
  axis.text = element_text(colour = "white"),
  axis.line = element_line(colour = "white")
) 
plt_dark_bg
```

Since the plot is a ggplot object, we can export them using either the
export button in Rstudio's panel, or the ggsave function:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggsave(filename="output/spatial_plot_darkbg.png", plot=plt_dark_bg)
```

<summary>Customising SpatialFeaturePlot with multiple features</summary>

<hr>

When there are multiple features drawn using `SpatialFeaturePlot`, 
the resulting object is no longer a ggplot object but rather a "Large patchwork" object, 
an object generated by the [patchwork package](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/index.html).
This package is commonly used for combining plots in R.
In actual fact, the large patchwork object itself is a list where each element is a ggplot object.
Thus, to modify the plot, you will just need to override each object like above.
